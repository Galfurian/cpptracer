# CPPTracer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer)

The Tracer is a class which allows to generate vcd files from c++ variables. It
can be of use for tracing variables during the simulation of both discrete and
continuous time models. The tracer itself is pretty simple to use. Have a look
at the test code (inside tests) for an example of use.

## Structure
